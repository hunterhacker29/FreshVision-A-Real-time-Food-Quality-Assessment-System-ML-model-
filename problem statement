Problem Statement:
Develop a model for detecting the freshness of fresh produce, specifically fruits and vegetables,
by analyzing various visual cues and patterns. The model should predict the shelf life of these 
items and assess their freshness. Participating teams are required to train the model on perishable
items such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and other food items like bread.


Proposed System: 
The proposed system utilizes image processing techniques, a CNN model, and OCR functionality to predict 
the freshness and shelf life of fruits and vegetables. Users can upload images of produce, and the system
will assess freshness levels and estimate remaining shelf life. Additionally, users can input storage temperature
to improve prediction accuracy. The integrated OCR allows users to upload pictures of produce tags or labels, 
extracting relevant information like product name or expiration date. A user-friendly web interface will display 
freshness levels, estimated shelf life, and extracted label data, helping users make informed decisions and reduce waste.
