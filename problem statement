Problem Statement:
Develop a model for detecting the freshness of fresh produce, specifically fruits and vegetables,
by analyzing various visual cues and patterns. The model should predict the shelf life of these 
items and assess their freshness. Participating teams are required to train the model on perishable
items such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and other food items like bread.

Proposed System: Fruit Freshness and Shelf Life Prediction using Image Processing and CNN Model

Overview: The system aims to predict the freshness and shelf life of fruits and vegetables using 
image processing techniques, powered by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to provide 
an intuitive interface for users to upload images of fresh produce, and the system will output the predicted 
freshness level and estimated remaining shelf life.
