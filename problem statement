Problem Statement:
Develop a model for detecting the freshness of fresh produce, specifically fruits and vegetables,
by analyzing various visual cues and patterns. The model should predict the shelf life of these 
items and assess their freshness. Participating teams are required to train the model on perishable
items such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and other food items like bread.


Proposed System: 
The proposed system utilizes image processing techniques and a CNN model to predict the freshness and 
shelf life of fruits and vegetables. Users can upload images of produce, and the system will assess freshness 
levels and estimate remaining shelf life. Additionally, users can input storage temperature . A user-friendly web application interface will display results, including freshness levels, 
estimated shelf life, and label information, empowering users to make informed decisions about their fresh produce and minimize waste.
